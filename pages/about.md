        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          I'm an MIS & Accounting student with hands-on experience across cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, data analytics, and consulting. I've shipped client-ready deliverables in fast-moving environments (West Monroe, IBM, PwC), led digital transformation initiatives with Data Driven WV, and built full-stack tools for nonprofits and small businesses.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Contributed to a $1.2B statewide broadband initiative, delivered automation that cut manual work by 95%, and co-founded CookieIO with $44k+ revenue and 50% margins.</p>

      <p>
        Born and raised in Mexico, I completed my early education at Prepa TEC before moving to the United States at 18. I finished my senior year of high school in Laredo, Texas, and am now pursuing my MIS & Accounting degree at West Virginia University, expected to graduate in December 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        This cross-cultural journey has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and innovation. As a Latino in technology, I'm passionate about creating opportunities for underrepresented communities and building bridges between diverse perspectives. My background has taught me to approach challenges with resilience, adaptability, and a deep appreciation for the power of technology to transform communities.
