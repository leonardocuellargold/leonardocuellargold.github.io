Welcome to my digital space! I'm excited to share my journey in technology, consulting, and continuous learning. This portfolio represents more than just a collection of projects—it's a reflection of my growth as a professional and my passion for solving complex problems.

## Why I Built This Portfolio

As someone working at the intersection of technology strategy, data analytics, and cloud infrastructure, I wanted to create a platform that showcases not just what I've built, but how I think about problems and solutions. This site is powered by **GitHub Pages + Jekyll**, emphasizing my preference for clean, maintainable, and scalable solutions.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Experience Stories**: Deep dives into my roles at West Monroe, IBM, and Data Driven WV
- **Project Showcases**: Technical projects with real business impact
- **Learning Reflections**: Insights from certifications and professional development
- **Industry Thoughts**: My perspective on cloud, data, and digital transformation

## The Tech Stack

This portfolio leverages:
- Jekyll for static site generation
- SCSS for maintainable styling
- YAML data files for easy content management
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility-first approach

I believe in "less is more"—clean code, elegant design, and meaningful content over flashy features.

Stay tuned for more insights from my journey in technology consulting and cloud infrastructure!
