When I think about where I learned the most about consulting, collaboration, and curiosity, Data Driven WV will always be the first place that comes to mind. It was the organization that took a chance on me — letting me shadow a project - as a freshman - when I was still figuring out where I wanted to fit in — and, within a year, trusted me to lead projects of my own.

It’s where I realized there’s no real limit to curiosity — just opportunities to keep asking better questions.

## A Beginning Built on Curiosity  

I joined Data Driven WV as a student analyst, eager to learn but unsure of what consulting really looked like in practice. My first project was more observation than contribution — watching the process of translating organizational problems into data-driven solutions.  

But even from the sidelines, I was fascinated. The combination of technical work, business reasoning, and real social impact immediately clicked for me. I knew I wanted to dive deeper.  

And before long, I did.

## Leading Projects, One Step at a Time  

By my second semester, I began taking on more ownership — first in research and visualization, then in project management. Eventually, I found myself leading projects with real clients, coordinating teams, and delivering tangible results across the Appalachia.

Each project taught me something new — not just about data, but about people and purpose.

### Nemacolin — Digitalizing Generosity  

One of the most rewarding experiences was leading the*Nemacolin donor certificate digitalization project, where our team created a no-code platform to automate gift certificate management. We connected the resort’s donation intake system with a certificate generation platform and even explored Apple and Google Wallet integration for a seamless guest experience.  

That project showed me how automation and empathy can coexist — technology isn’t just about efficiency; it’s about enabling better human experiences.

### WesBanco — Business Intelligence for Growth  

The WesBanco project I explored strategic geospatial and demographic analytics. Our goal was to identify optimal branch expansion zones by analyzing financial, demographic, and traffic data. I developed ranking models and visualization layers that helped executives make informed strategic decisions.  

It was my first real taste of data storytelling — transforming complex datasets into clear, visual insights that drive decisions.

### Loudoun Cares — Secure Digital Intake  

For Loudoun Cares, I designed a HIPAA-compliant document intake system using Google Apps Script and custom web app logic. The goal was to automate secure client intake, reducing manual errors and improving response time. We implemented web application firewalls and ensured data governance best practices for nonprofits with limited resources.  

That experience taught me the responsibility that comes with designing systems people trust — especially when handling sensitive information.

### West Virginia Broadband — Research that Matters  

Working alongside the WV Office of Broadband, I supported statewide geospatial analysis for broadband expansion under the BEAD program. We used Python, GeoPandas, and TensorFlow to identify underserved areas and visualize broadband accessibility.  

I also helped develop methods to group metropolitan service areas (MSAs) fairly for bidding — packaging high-demand zones with rural regions to promote equitable access. It was complex, challenging, and deeply meaningful work that connected analytics with real-world policy impact.

## The Power of Experiential Learning  

What makes Data Driven WV special is how it turns classrooms into real consulting labs. We weren’t just learning concepts — we were building solutions. From requirement-gathering meetings to stakeholder presentations, everything felt hands-on, relevant, and fast-paced.  

I was surrounded by mentors and peers who pushed me to think critically and act boldly. Professors and project leads gave us the freedom to explore, fail, iterate, and grow — the exact kind of environment where curiosity thrives.

## Looking Back  

A year at Data Driven WV changed how I think about my career — and myself. I entered as someone curious about data and left as someone confident in using it to drive change.  

It’s where I learned how to lead, how to listen, and how to connect technology with human stories. Most of all, it’s where I learned that curiosity doesn’t have a ceiling — only new directions to explore.

*Data Driven WV will always be the place that gave me my career start — where I first saw the power of data and technology to transform communities and where I discovered that every good question is the start of something bigger.*
