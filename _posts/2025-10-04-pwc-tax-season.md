When people talk about “busy season,” they usually mention the long hours — but for me, it was about the momentum. Every day brought a new challenge, a new learning curve, and a deeper appreciation for what public accounting really feels like.  

This past winter/spring (2025), I joined PwC’s Wealth Management Tax Services practice in Pittsburgh, supporting a major U.S. banking client. It was my first real taste of busy season from the inside — and it lived up to the name in the best possible way.

## Fast-Paced from Day One  

The rhythm started early and didn’t slow down. Hundreds of tax forms, multiple state filings, and tight deadlines — it was the perfect environment to learn how precision and teamwork keep everything running. I quickly learned that in a firm like PwC, communication and process are everything.  

I supported data validation and diagnostic resolution, helping ensure compliance and accuracy across complex datasets. Every file had a story behind it, and every number needed to make sense not just mathematically, but strategically.  

But the part that truly energized me was how technology fit into all of it.

## Finding Efficiency Through Automation  

Somewhere between reconciling data and reviewing return batches, I started building Python automations to handle repetitive tasks. One of those scripts doubled our preparation efficiency — a small internal win that saved hours every season.  

That hands-on experience reminded me how much I enjoy blending finance and tech — building tools that not only make work faster, but smarter.  

Later in the season, I designed a liability forecasting model using Alteryx and VBA, helping streamline review processes across the engagement team. Seeing a model I built directly improve workflows for senior associates and managers was one of the most rewarding parts of the internship.

## Collaboration and Mentorship  

Despite the pace, PwC’s culture stood out. There’s a deep sense of support and mentorship that runs through the team — people genuinely want to help you grow, even during their busiest months.  

I had mentors who walked me through both the technical tax details and the consulting mindset behind client service. It wasn’t just about numbers; it was about understanding what those numbers meant for the client’s broader financial picture.  

That exposure to high-level strategy and day-to-day execution was invaluable. I learned how decisions are made in real time — how client expectations, deadlines, and technology all intersect.

## Lessons from Busy Season  

By the end of busy season, I had a new appreciation for the structure, intensity, and collaboration that define consulting in tax. It’s not just about spreadsheets and returns — it’s about how people and processes adapt under pressure.  

I walked away with stronger analytical skills, a better sense of how to communicate value through data, and a deep respect for the people who keep these massive operations running seamlessly every year.  

Most of all, I learned how to think like a tax accountant — balancing efficiency with judgment, automation with understanding, and speed with precision.
