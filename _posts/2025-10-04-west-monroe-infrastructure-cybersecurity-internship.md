This summer was one for the books. Between early mornings in Midtown, late-night slices in the city, and everything in between, I got to experience what real consulting feels like at West Monroe. I joined the Technology Experience practice, focusing on Infrastructure and Cybersecurity, and quickly realized that every day brought something new — new challenges, new conversations, and a team that made the work exciting.

## A Summer in the City

From day one, I could feel the energy of being in the Big Apple. There was something special about walking into the Midtown office, grabbing coffee (and virtual coffee chats) with consultants before client calls, and ending the day exploring the city that never sleeps.  
But beyond the skyline, what made this summer stand out was the people — the mentors, the fellow interns, and the incredible culture that West Monroe cultivates. Trivia Tuesdays became a ritual.

## The Consulting Experience, Up Close

My main project was part of a large-scale IT integration, supporting a 50-person engagement team driving the technology transformation for a global enterprise. I worked within the infrastructure workstream, where we collaborated across multiple disciplines — cybersecurity, enterprise tech, and project IMO — to prepare for Day 1 readiness and beyond.  

There were days spent in client meetings, others in war-room-style conference sessions filled with whiteboards, sticky notes, and strategy discussions. I had the chance to support conversations with senior executives and C-suite leaders, helping translate technical recommendations into business outcomes. Every meeting reinforced how consulting is equal parts strategy, communication, and execution.

## Migration Weekends and Real-World Impact

One of the most memorable parts of the internship was participating in migration efforts across multiple client sites. Our team executed workstation and network migrations across several states — all in a single weekend.  
From running PowerShell scripts and configuring telephony systems to helping users through hypercare, it was hands-on, fast-moving, and incredibly rewarding. Knowing that our team’s work directly enabled hundreds of employees to transition smoothly to new systems reminded me what impact feels like at scale.

## The Chicago Experience

Midway through the summer, I had the chance to travel to Chicago for the Intern Conference — a highlight of my internship. Meeting interns from across the country, especially those in Tech Experience, was energizing. We shared project stories, career goals, and laughs that turned into friendships. It was inspiring to see how diverse yet unified everyone was under the same consulting mindset — client-first, team-driven, and always curious.

## What I’ll Take With Me

This summer wasn’t just about technical growth — it was about learning how to think like a consultant. I gained confidence in problem-solving under pressure, learned the importance of cross-functional collaboration, and saw how strategy and technology intersect in real time.  

But above all, it was the people that made this internship special — the mentors who took time to teach, the teammates who made every challenge a group effort, and the friends who made Trivia Tuesdays and Happy Hour one of the best parts of the week.

*To me, this summer at West Monroe wasn’t just an internship — it was a preview of the kind of career I want to build: one where curiosity meets impact, and where every day brings a new challenge.*
