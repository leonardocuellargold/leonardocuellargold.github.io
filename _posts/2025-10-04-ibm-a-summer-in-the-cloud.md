If I had to describe my summer at IBM, I’d say it was a mix of mentorship, creativity, and community — all set against the backdrop of my first summer living in New York City. I joined IBM Consulting under the Hybrid Cloud Services line, supporting clients in the telecommunications space. What started as an internship quickly turned into one of the most transformative experiences I’ve had so far — one that combined technical growth with human connection, and professional learning with personal discovery.

## First Impressions — The City and the People

There’s nothing quite like starting your first summer in Manhattan. From catching the subway on the first day to grabbing coffee before client stand-ups, the pace of the city perfectly matched IBM’s culture of innovation and forward momentum.  

What stood out most to me early on was IBM’s value-driven culture — it’s built around growth, trust, and inclusion. Every conversation, from leadership town halls to one-on-one check-ins, reflected a sense of purpose and mentorship that felt genuine. I was surrounded by people who not only knew their craft but were just as passionate about helping others grow.

## The Hybrid Cloud Experience  

In the Hybrid Cloud Services practice, I worked on projects that lived at the intersection of infrastructure and innovation. My focus was in the telecommunications sector, where I supported analysis, automation, and reporting for client systems leveraging AWS, GCP, and Red Hat OpenShift.  

It was during this time that I became fascinated with AIOps — using AI to make IT operations smarter, faster, and more resilient. Watching how IBM’s teams approached operational challenges with AI-driven solutions opened a whole new area of interest for me. It was the perfect balance of technical depth and strategic thinking.

I also earned my Google Cloud Associate Engineer certification, which not only strengthened my technical foundation but gave me the confidence to contribute meaningfully to hybrid architectures. It was one of those milestones that made all the late nights and study sessions worth it.

## Innovation at Astor Place  

One of the coolest moments of the summer was getting a quick look inside the IBM Innovation Lab at Astor Place. Even though I was only there for a short time, it left a big impression — seeing robotics, AI systems, and interactive prototypes all working together felt like stepping into the future.

Witnessing how IBM integrates design, engineering, and data to transform ideas into reality was captivating. This brief visit reminded me about my passion for technology—the thrill of seeing innovation unfold and recognizing how human-computer interaction powers it all.

## The Summit and Beyond  

The Google Cloud + IBM Summit in NYC was another highlight. I had the chance to support the event and meet professionals shaping the hybrid cloud space at scale. Seeing IBM and Google Cloud’s collaboration up close showed me the impact of alignment between technology partners — it’s what drives modern digital transformation.  

That summer, I delivered a presentation titled "OpenShift on GCP: A Hybrid Cloud Strategy," which examined how enterprises can build scalable, resilient systems across multiple environments. This marked my first time presenting to senior consultants and architects at an enterprise company—I enjoyed every moment, particularly the discussions that followed.

## Culture, Mentorship, and Growth  

What made IBM special wasn’t just the work — it was the people. From mentors who always made time for feedback, to the interns who turned into close friends (many of whom I still talk to today), the sense of community was real.  

IBM’s mentorship platform connected us with leaders across practices, letting us schedule sessions with architects, project managers, and even managing partners. It was one of those rare opportunities where you could sit down with someone far ahead in their career and ask, “How did you get there?” — and they’d tell you, honestly and openly.  

We also took part in IBM’s Day of Service, where our intern group built sensory kits for children with autism. It was a reminder that IBM’s focus on impact goes far beyond technology — it’s deeply human. And yes, I even made time for a few “firsts” outside of work — like my first Yankees game (and first MLB game), which made me feel like a true New Yorker for a night.

## Looking Back  

By the end of the summer, I had grown more than I could’ve imagined — not just technically, but personally. IBM showed me what it means to combine innovation with purpose. It’s a place where experimentation is encouraged, mentorship is built into the culture, and curiosity is celebrated as a strength.  

It was the summer where I discovered my interest in AIOps, earned my first major cloud certification, and got to experience New York in a way that will stay with me forever. Most importantly, it was the summer that reminded me how much I love being part of something bigger — where technology, teamwork, and creativity all come together to make an impact.
